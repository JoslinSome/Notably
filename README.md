# Notably

Notably is a versatile mobile and web application designed to enhance the studying experience for students. It addresses common challenges students face when organizing and presenting their notes while also offering innovative study features.

## Inspiration
Our motivation behind developing Notably was to simplify note management and improve study methods. We aimed to create a tool that allows students to organize and present their notes in an appealing manner while also making the studying process more efficient.

## Features

### Note Capture and Styling
- Capture images of handwritten notes and store them digitally.
- Present notes in an aesthetically pleasing format.
- Customize note presentation with specific schemas, including tables and block inputs.

### Powerful Search
- Effortlessly search through all your notes for quick content retrieval.

### Intelligent Study Assistance
- The application's review section utilizes Chat GPT to generate personalized flashcard quizzes based on your notebook content.
- Enhance your study experience with tailored quizzes that adapt to your notes.

## How It's Built
Notably is built using the MERN stack:
- React for the web client.
- React Native for the mobile client.
- Express and Node.js for the backend.
- MongoDB for data storage.

To implement handwriting recognition, we integrated the Google Cloud Vision API. For dynamic quiz generation, we harnessed the power of the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API.

## Challenges
Our journey involved overcoming challenges related to API setup and text parsing. We successfully tackled these hurdles to ensure the seamless functioning of all APIs.

## Accomplishments
We're proud to have transformed our initial ideas into a fully functional application. Our achievement lies in creating an accessible and effective tool for students.

## What We Learned
Developing Notably allowed us to gain expertise in API key management and introduced some of our team members to React development.

## What's Next for Notably
Notably's future includes expanding customization options, allowing users to define colors and font weights for text chunks. We're also planning to introduce support for a code terminal, enabling users to write and run code within the app.

Stay tuned for exciting updates that will further enhance your study experience with Notably!
